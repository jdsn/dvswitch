Example Pd patch to demonstrate the dvswitch remote control API.

Prerequisites
-------------
You will need Pure Data: http://puredata.info and the sendOSC external.

The quickest way to get started is to get it directly from upstream:
Download Pd-extended (includes many externals incl. sendOSC objects).
It is available for various platforms and distributions:
http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended

vanilla Pd (without externals) is available on many GNU/Linux distributions.
However, the sendOSC external is not packaged for debian. It is available from
http://pure-data.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pure-data/trunk/externals/OSCx/


Usage
-----
Launch dvswitch with the '-o 5675' option to make it listen for OSC messages on
UDP port 5675 and connect at least two dv-source to dvswitch (so that the
effects work):

  # dvswitch -o 5675 &
  # dvsource-file -l /tmp/some_file.dv &
  # dvsource-file -l /tmp/another_file.dv &

Then just open 'remote-control.pd' in this folder:

  # puredata remote-control.pd

Push the buttons, move sliders in the Pd patch..

have fun,
robin
